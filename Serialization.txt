All built-in classes like String, arrays, collections 
  except maps are serializable.


1) You need to implement Serializable interface, for serialization.

2) If it is not implemented, NotSerialzableException is 
   thrown when serialization is done.

3) Static/ transient variables are never serialized.

   Employee is not Serializable empid, name,salary
   Manager is Serializable - da, hra, pf, incentive, Address address

   Only Manager's attributes will be serialized.
   Calls constructor for Employee class.

   Make Employee to implement Serializable.
   Manager becomes Serializable by default.

   Manager HAS-A Address
   Address is not implementing Serializable interface.
   address variable will not be serialized.
   Make Address Serializable.

   Manager will implement Externalizable interface.
   Implement its two methods:
	writeObject, readObject

   Implement two methods:
	writeObject, readObject as private Access Modifier.
   You are implementing Serializable interface only.
